# convolution
## Experiments in convolution in haskell

The starting point for this experiment is https://www.blaenkdenum.com/posts/naive-convolution-in-haskell/
from 2013. The performance results are, however, very different: the naive
approach is fastest. Note that the `stream-fusion` package is no longer
available.

We will try though...

And testing on a MacBook Pro 2018, the naivest implementation still wins,
even over `Data.Vector`.  `Data.Vector.Unboxed` seems to be slower.
